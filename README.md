## 🧠 Notes
- 🧾 Integrated **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** and **Vercel Web Analytics** for tracking user engagement.
- ⚠️ GA4 may show console warnings if tracking is blocked by your browser, totally normal.
- ⏳ The skeleton loader might slightly increase LCP, but it keeps the loading experience smooth and elegant.
